              My Story of how I got into this field..
            </h4>
            <p>
              Real Estate Agent with a passion in full-stack development. I am a
              creative thinker who is curious and incredibly motivated to learn
              new languages and frameworks. Working in various sectors allowed
              me to become able to adapt to brand new working environments
              quickly. With the positive and enthusiastic personality I possess,
              I thrive in both teams and independent settings.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Since graduating from University of Toronto's Criminology &
              Socio-Legal Studies and Finnish Studies Program in 2015, I've set
              out on a journey to different parts of the globe to learn about
              different cultures and the vast world around me, but also to
              discover myself and passions. I've traveled to 10+ new countries
              and worked in Finland, Taiwan and Canada, where I've volunteered
              and worked in various fields as a Educator, Real Estate Agent,
              Server and Military Conscript.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Through my experiences living in various countries and meeting
              people from different walks of life, I've developed a keen
              interest in Software Development. Speaking with people who
              currently work in this field, I was fascinated by the type of work
              they do, what they are capable of creating, and learning how
              supportive everyone in the industry was with each other. I was
              also amazed by the idea of being able to connect and work with
              people from around the world through the channel of programming
              languages.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
              With this, I enrolled and graduated from the Lighthouse Labs'
              Full-Stack Web Development Program in the summer of 2020. Needless
              to say, it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life,
              and further reinforced my new found passion.
